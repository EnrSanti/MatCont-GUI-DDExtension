# MatCont-GUI-DDExtension
The extension of MatCont user interface to systems of delay differential equations. Project done as Curricular Internship. 

CURRENT VERSION:

The current version of the project SHOULD allow the user to insert systems of DDEs and analyse their different aspects (i.e. do all the operations previously doable on ODE systems).

Currently ONLY ONE DELAY PARAMETER IS ACCEPTED.
Please when inserting the a DDE use square brackets [] to insert the delay (e.g. y'=parameter\*y\*y[t-TAU]).

TODO:

-~~extend the system to accept multiple delay parameters~~

-~~extend the system to accept non constant delay parameters~~
- check wether in systems file use min/max
- eventual bug fixes
- code refactoring (i.e. the code is messy)
-~~continue code documentation~~
- find the definition of the "starter" window and add a label to divide the delay from the other parameters
